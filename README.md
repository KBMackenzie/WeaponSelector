A Cult of the Lamb mod that adds a little weapon selection menu window to the game's pause menu.

You can select **any weapon and curse** from that menu, and you're guaranteed to get them in any dungeon's equipment-spawning room.

The little weapon selection menu is **draggable**, and looks like this:

You can navigate through the choices by clicking on the arrows.
You can also navigate through them with your **keyboard**, pressing **J, K, or L** to move through **Weapon**, **Trait** or **Curse**, respectively.

#### Installation (Manual)
1. Download and install BepInEx.
    1. If you're downloading it from [its Github page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases), follow [this installation guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html#where-to-download-bepinex).
    2. If you're downloading ["BepInExPack CultOfTheLamb" from Thunderstore](https://cult-of-the-lamb.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_CultOfTheLamb/), follow the manual installation guide on the Thunderstore page itself. This one comes with a preconfigured `BepInEx.cfg` file, so it's advised you download this one.
2. Find the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
3. Place the contents of **"WeaponSelector.zip"** in a new folder within the plugins folder.

## How To Use
All you have to do is choose a **Weapon**, **Weapon Trait** and/or **Curse** from the menu and start a dungeon. Your choice of weapon and curse should be given to you at the start of the dungeon and in any weapon-selection rooms.

The menu's fields are:
1. Top: "Weapon" (e.g. Sword, Axe, Dagger).
2. Middle: "Weapon Trait" (e.g. Bane, Zealous, Godly).
3. Bottom: "Curse" (e.g. Divine Guardian, Flaming Shot).

You can also choose to let the mod randomize your weapon pool a bit!
A simple explanation:
1. Setting 'Weapon' to "Random" and choosing a specific Weapon Trait will give you a random weapon with that trait.
2. Setting 'Weapon Trait' to "Random" and choosing a specific Weapon will give you that weapon with a randomly selected trait.

All your weapon choices are saved to a text file named `WeaponChoice.txt` created inside of the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
